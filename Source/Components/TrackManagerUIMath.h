/**
 * @brief Clamp @p value into the interval described by @p a and @p b.
 *
 * The contract, in the order the function decides it:
 *
 * 1. **Bounds that describe no interval** (both non-finite) return `0.0f`. There
 *    is no in-range answer to give, so this stays the defensive sentinel it has
 *    always been. No caller passes such bounds today.
 * 2. **One non-finite bound** collapses to the other, giving a degenerate
 *    interval rather than discarding the call.
 * 3. **Inverted finite bounds are normalised**, not rejected. This is relied
 *    upon: `gridStartX = bounds.x + 236 + 5` and `gridEndX = bounds.x + width - 15`
 *    invert below ~256px of component width, and narrow windows are a supported
 *    layout (#551 audit).
 * 4. **Degenerate bounds** (`lo == hi`) return that bound.
 * 5. **Non-finite values, against a real interval**, resolve where the maths
 *    says they belong: `-inf → lo`, `+inf → hi`, `NaN → lo`. NaN has no ordering,
 *    so its answer is a deterministic choice rather than a derivation; the low
 *    end is picked because every caller's lower bound is a legal value for it.
 * 6. **Finite values** clamp normally.
 *
 * Rule 5 is the one that changed (#551). This previously returned `0.0f` for any
 * non-finite value, which is only in range for 3 of the 12 call sites — the
 * scroll-offset family, whose lower bound happens to be `0.0f`. For the other
 * nine it produced a value outside the caller's own interval, and for the four
 * zoom sites that value is a *divisor* in every x-to-beat conversion.
 *
 * Note this is hardening, not a repair: no path was found that actually feeds a
 * non-finite value in. It removes an invalid-state escape rather than a
 * reproducible defect.
