 * @file TextDiagnosticOverlay.h
 * @brief F11-toggleable text pipeline diagnostic (V8-C9, governed by FD-21)
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * Aestra's text has looked wrong on light themes for a long time, and the
 * reason tuning never converged is that the pipeline has four independent
 * causes and one shared knob. Screenshots could show that text looked wrong;
 * they could not say which mechanism made it wrong, because every variable
 * moves at once — theme luminance sets textContrast_, which resolves into two
 * shader uniforms, while the atlas tier is chosen by a threshold table and the
 * blend colour space depends on whether the widget happened to be cached.
 *
 * So this overlay is not a screenshot of the result. It does two things a
 * screenshot cannot:
 *
 *   1. Reports the pipeline's own state — the actual variable values and the
 *      uniforms they resolve to, read from the renderer rather than restated
 *      here. If the panel disagrees with the rendering, the panel is right
 *      about what the code intends and the rendering is the bug.
 *
 *   2. Varies exactly one thing per row. A difference between two samples in
 *      the same section is attributable to that section's variable and nothing
 *      else, which is what makes a visual judgement evidence instead of an
 *      impression.
 *
 * Sections A-D correspond to the audit's findings: A is the atlas tiers behind
 * F5, B is the alpha lift behind F7, C is the polarity compensation behind F3,
 * and D is the cached/uncached blend-space split that is F3 itself.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It changes no rendering behaviour and fixes nothing. Per FD-21 the ordering
 * is binding: establish the measured behaviour against the contract first. A
 * defect becoming visible here is not permission to tune it.
 *
 * LCD versus grayscale is absent by design rather than oversight. fontUseLCD_
 * is read inside buildAtlas, so switching it rebuilds all four atlases — a
 * restart-scoped toggle (AESTRA_DISABLE_LCD=1), not a column. The panel reports
 * which mode is live so a two-run comparison stays attributable.
