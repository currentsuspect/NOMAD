# Tests for check-rt-effects.sh — the B-005 compile-time constraint gate.
#
# THE DIRECTION THAT MATTERS IS THE FALSE PASS.
#
# A wrong rejection is loud: someone sees a red check and a diagnostic naming a
# function. A wrong acceptance is silent, and this gate's whole product is the
# sentence "the audio thread provably does not allocate or lock". A gate that
# emits that sentence without testing it is worse than no gate, because the claim
# then travels — into review, into the changelog, into a release note.
#
# So the tests below are mostly hostile, and the two that matter most are:
#
#   * a genuinely violating translation unit must FAIL, and the failure must
#     name -Wfunction-effects. Asserting merely "exit != 0" would pass if the
#     compiler crashed, if a header went missing, or if the script had a typo in
#     a variable name — three ways to look like a working gate while checking
#     nothing.
#   * a tree with no annotations at all must FAIL rather than report success on
#     an empty set. "0 of 0 translation units are clean" is true and useless.
#
# Everything here is hermetic: each case builds its own tiny source tree and its
# own compile_commands.json, so the tests never depend on the repo being
# configured, on a build directory existing, or on the current annotation set.

# Build a throwaway repo-shaped tree: AestraAudio/src/<name>.cpp plus a build
# directory holding a compile_commands.json that points at it.
#
# The script derives its file list by grepping AestraAudio/src and Source, so the
# fixture has to have that shape for the derivation to be under test at all. A
# fixture that fed the script a file list directly would be testing a different
# program from the one CI runs.
# The third argument is extra compile flags, defaulting to a define whose value
# contains quotes. That default is deliberate and is the regression: the script
# used to hand args to the compiler through an unquoted shell string, so a flag
# needing quoting arrived with its quote characters intact and clang reported a
# missing file. Every flag in the tree was quote-free until AESTRA_VERSION_STRING
# was added, so the gate broke on its own plumbing the day a version reached it.
# Baking it into the default fixture means every case below now exercises it.
