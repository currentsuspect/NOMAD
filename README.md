# Nomad Core

This repository contains the open-source core of the Nomad DAW engine.

- Public: `nomad-core/` (buildable standalone with mock assets)
- Private: `nomad-premium/` (paid plugins, models), `nomad-build/` (build/signing)

Premium features are developed and released privately by Nomad Studios.

## Build (Windows)

1. Install CMake, Git, a C++ toolchain (MSVC) and PowerShell 7.
2. Install Git hooks:
   - `pwsh -File scripts/install-hooks.ps1`
3. Configure and build:
   - `cmake -S . -B build -DNOMAD_CORE_MODE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
   - `cmake --build build --config Release --parallel`

If private repos are present and you disable core-only mode, full builds can be made in private environments.

## Security

- `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` block/route large or sensitive files.
- Pre-commit hook prevents committing secrets or private assets.
- Gitleaks workflow scans for secrets on pushes/PRs.
