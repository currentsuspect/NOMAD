## 📖 License Philosophy

### Why Source-Available Instead of Open-Source?

We chose a source-available model for several reasons:

**1. Sustainability**
- Allows Nomad Studios to build a sustainable business model
- Enables funding for long-term development and support
- Protects against commercial exploitation by larger companies

**2. Quality Control**
- Maintains a cohesive vision and design philosophy
- Ensures professional-grade quality standards
- Prevents fragmentation into incompatible forks

**3. Transparency**
- Source code visibility builds trust with users
- Educational value for students and developers
- Community can verify security and correctness

**4. Protection**
- Safeguards innovative features and technology
- Prevents competitors from copying unique implementations
- Preserves intellectual property value

**Source-available ≠ Open-source**, but we believe this model offers the best balance of transparency and sustainability.
