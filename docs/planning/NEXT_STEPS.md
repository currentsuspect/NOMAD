# Then run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/NOMAD.git
git push -u origin master
git push --tags
```

### 2. Choose Your Next Feature

Pick one of these to implement next:

#### Option A: Windows Platform Layer ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Why:** Need this to actually see the UI working  
**Time:** 1-2 days  
**Difficulty:** Medium

**What you'll build:**
- Native Windows window creation
- OpenGL context management
- Mouse and keyboard event handling
- High-DPI support

**Start with:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/windows-platform-layer
```

#### Option B: Text Rendering System
**Why:** Need text for labels, buttons, etc.  
**Time:** 2-3 days  
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard

**What you'll build:**
- FreeType integration
- Font loading and caching
- Text layout engine
- Label widget

**Start with:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/text-rendering
```

#### Option C: Core Widget Set
**Why:** Need more UI components  
**Time:** 3-5 days  
**Difficulty:** Medium

**What you'll build:**
- Slider (horizontal/vertical)
- Knob (rotary control)
- TextInput
- ComboBox
- ScrollView

**Start with:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/core-widgets
```

## 📋 Recommended Development Order

### Phase 1: Make UI Visible (Week 1)
1. ✅ Foundation complete
2. **Windows platform layer** ← YOU ARE HERE
3. **Simple demo window**
4. **Text rendering basics**

### Phase 2: Expand UI (Week 2-3)
5. **Core widgets** (slider, knob, label)
6. **Layout system**
7. **Drag and drop**
8. **Context menus**

### Phase 3: DAW Integration (Week 4-6)
9. **VST3 plugin hosting**
10. **Mixer and routing**
11. **Automation system**
12. **MIDI support**

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 7-8)
13. **Performance optimization**
14. **User preferences**
15. **Project save/load**
16. **Export/render**

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes...
# Test changes...

# Commit with semantic message
git add .
git commit -m "feat(ui): add your feature

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
- Detail 3"

# Merge back to master when complete
git checkout master
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git tag v0.2.0-alpha
```

### Testing Before Commit
```bash
# Build NomadUI tests
cd NomadUI/build
cmake --build .

# Run tests
./bin/Debug/NomadUI_MinimalTest.exe

# Build NOMAD DAW
cd ../../build
cmake --build .

# Run DAW
./bin/Debug/NOMAD.exe
```

## 📚 Resources You'll Need

### For Windows Platform Layer
- Windows API documentation
- OpenGL context creation (wglCreateContext)
- Window message handling (WndProc)
- High-DPI awareness

### For Text Rendering
- FreeType library
- Font file formats (TTF, OTF)
- Text layout algorithms
- Unicode handling

### For Widgets
- UI design patterns
- Event handling
- State management
- Animation curves

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### For Windows Platform Layer
- [ ] Window opens and displays
- [ ] OpenGL context created successfully
- [ ] Can render basic shapes
- [ ] Mouse events work (click, move, drag)
- [ ] Keyboard events work
- [ ] Window can resize
- [ ] High-DPI displays work correctly

### For Text Rendering
- [ ] Can load TTF/OTF fonts
- [ ] Can render text at different sizes
- [ ] Text is crisp and anti-aliased
- [ ] Can measure text dimensions
- [ ] Can align text (left, center, right)
- [ ] Can render multi-line text

### For Core Widgets
- [ ] Slider works (horizontal/vertical)
- [ ] Knob works (rotary control)
- [ ] TextInput works (keyboard input)
- [ ] ComboBox works (dropdown)
- [ ] ScrollView works (scrolling)
- [ ] All widgets use theme colors
- [ ] All widgets have smooth animations

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
Don't try to implement everything at once. Get one thing working, commit it, then move to the next.

### 2. Test Frequently
Run tests after every change. Catch bugs early.

### 3. Document as You Go
Add comments and update docs while the code is fresh in your mind.

### 4. Commit Often
Small, focused commits are better than large, monolithic ones.

### 5. Ask for Help
If you get stuck, check the documentation or ask for assistance.

## 🎨 My Recommendation

**Start with the Windows Platform Layer!**

Why?
- You need it to see anything on screen
- It's the foundation for all UI work
- It's satisfying to see your first window open
- Once it's done, everything else becomes easier

**Next steps:**
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/windows-platform-layer`
2. Create `NomadUI/Platform/Windows/NUIWindowWin32.h`
3. Create `NomadUI/Platform/Windows/NUIWindowWin32.cpp`
4. Implement window creation
5. Implement OpenGL context
6. Implement event handling
7. Test with simple demo
8. Commit and merge

**Estimated time:** 1-2 days  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Reward:** Seeing your UI framework come to life! 🎉
