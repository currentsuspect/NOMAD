# Nomad Studios Manifesto – 2025-10-30

Nomad exists to make professional music tools accessible to everyone.
We believe software should feel like art — light, native, and human.

- **Nomad Core will always be free.**
- **We will never lock creativity behind subscriptions.**
- **Those who believe in Nomad can support through Muse or donations.**
- **Transparency is our contract with the community.**

Built with ❤️ by Dylan and the Nomad family.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where music creation is barrier-free, where the only limit is your imagination, not your budget. We're committed to keeping Nomad's core features free forever while building a sustainable model that respects both creators and users.
