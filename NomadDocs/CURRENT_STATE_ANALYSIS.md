## üéØ Final Thoughts

**Where NOMAD Stands Today:**
NOMAD is a **functional DAW prototype** with professional audio infrastructure and FL Studio-inspired UI. The timeline, waveform visualization, and transport controls are polished and stable. The audio engine is production-quality.

**What's Missing:**
The gap between "prototype" and "production DAW" is **sample manipulation** (drag-and-drop, editing), **mixing controls** (volume, pan, mute, solo), and **project persistence** (save/load). These three features are critical for daily use.

**Recommended Focus:**
1. **Immediate (1 month):** Sample manipulation + mixing controls + save/load
2. **Short-term (3 months):** Undo/redo + BPM control + loop regions
3. **Medium-term (6 months):** Effects chain + automation
4. **Long-term (12 months):** MIDI sequencing + VST hosting

**The Path Forward:**
NOMAD has a **solid foundation**. The architecture is clean, the audio is professional, and the UI is polished. Focus on **user workflow** (drag samples, mix tracks, save projects) before adding advanced features (effects, MIDI, VST). Build the DAW musicians need, not the DAW feature lists demand.

**You've built something impressive. Now make it indispensable.**
