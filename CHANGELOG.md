## v0.7.0-alpha — Routing, Automation & Hosting Milestone (2026-08-16)

338 PRs merged (#624–#775). The story of this milestone is coherence: routing and gain staging are correct end to end, automation lanes are actually automatable, the Master channel is a real plugin host whose latency sits in the compensation graph, and the piano roll grew from an editor into a workflow.

> **Versions, clarified.** `v0.7.0-alpha` is the *application release version*. It is unrelated to `ProjectSerializer::PROJECT_VERSION_CURRENT` (the project/file format version, currently 3): the format version changes only when the `.aes` format itself changes, never on a release bump.

### Routing & Mixing Correctness

- Unity gain law end to end: channel strips use the stereo-balance law, so routing a signal through any mixer channel no longer attenuates it — and the same law governs live playback, offline export, isolated bounce, audition preview, and input monitoring (parity pinned by tests).
- Fader and pan applied once: one UI gesture no longer writes two stores that the engine multiplied (−6 dB on the fader used to play at −12 dB).
- Routing command seam with mutation-time cycle rejection, stable send IDs, and master-legality enforcement; render-path semantics match the routing contract (V1/V2/V3) with live/offline parity.
- Master channel is a valid plugin host: insert chains process on the master bus before the fader and safety limiter, persist in the project file, and their latency feeds the plugin-delay-compensation graph (reported project latency is now the real end-to-end delay).
- Master-routed clips obey the live solo gate; isolated-track bounce renders only the selected track's stage and excludes the master stage by design — both halves of the isolation contract are pinned by tests.

### Automation

- Automation targets the plugin instance it was drawn for, never the slot it occupied — chain
  reordering keeps curves bound to their plugin (#766).
- Empty lanes are automatable: the first click creates a neutral Volume curve bound to the lane's
  channel, and edits rebuild the audio graph and mark the project dirty.
- Leftover demo automation removed from the default project and from previously saved projects.
- Empty lanes are automatable: the first click creates a neutral Volume curve bound to the lane's channel; edits rebuild the audio graph and mark the project dirty.
- Leftover demo automation removed from the default project and from previously saved projects.

### Piano Roll & Sequencing

- Selection subdivision by snap, proportional selection stretching, chord-aware stroke input, harmony context persistence, contextual editor workspace, playhead alignment in timeline mode, and bidirectional sampler ping-pong loops.

### UI & Editing

- Design constitution pass across mixer, browser, timeline, and arsenal.
- Audio Clip editor: musical pitching, trim persistence, live waveform updates, resize-safe layout.
- Timeline geometry has a single authority for grid and x→beat conversion.

### Reliability & Hardening

- Security, durability, and realtime contract lanes are CI-authoritative; test contract coverage and founder decision citations are enforced gates.
- Plugin hosting compiles in CI; Windows plugins run sandboxed out-of-process; CLAP SDK vendored.
- The routing/automation/master/UI triage branch went through four review rounds (human + CodeRabbit) with 20 findings addressed before merge.
- License-signing worker dependencies cleaned (undici CVEs).

## v0.7.1-alpha — Trust Sprint (2026-09-07)

Reliability is the feature. This milestone carried exactly one new capability by
design (FD-13); everything else removes a reason a first session ends badly.

### The seam that was reported nine times

The week before this sprint produced nine founder-reported bugs, all in one
family: the UI told you one thing and the engine did another.

- **Pattern edits now reach playback.** Unmuting a channel, and slicing a
  pattern, both left the scheduler evaluating the old structure until an
  unrelated edit forced a refresh — so the timeline showed one arrangement and
  you heard another. Split, delete, mute, solo, undo and drop all reschedule
  now. (#879)
- **Stop lands at zero.** A single stop left the playhead visibly off the start.
  (#868)
- **Recording lines up under latency.** Takes are placed with device latency
  compensated and the capture stamped from the engine frame, so a track recorded
  through a high-latency plugin chain sits where you played it. (#881)

### Losing work is harder

- **Missing audio is recoverable.** A project whose audio files have moved now
  opens with a relink dialog instead of failing quietly. (#876)
- **Recovery no longer doubles your tracks.** Loading cleared the track table
  first, so a recovered project came back with every track twice.

### The one feature

- **Fit audio clip to N bars.** Varispeed tempo-fit, pitch follows tempo, riding
  the existing ratio pipe — no new DSP and no format change. (#747)

### Producer-facing

- **Aestra Transient**, an internal envelope shaper: attack/decay gain scaling,
  zero latency, no PDC. A drum-workflow tool, not a centrepiece. (#869, #873)
- **Mixer plugin menus** are populated from a metadata catalog rather than a
  hand-maintained list, and now open where you clicked. (#872, #875)

### Trust infrastructure

- **The audio thread is checked at compile time.** `AESTRA_RT_NONBLOCKING`
  (Clang's function-effects analysis) makes allocation, locks, throws and
  unresolvable calls on an annotated real-time path a build error rather than a
  code-review note. Enforced in CI. Coverage starts at `TruePeakMeter` and grows
  per annotation; extending it to the callback itself is tracked separately.
- **One RT reporting API.** `Source/AudioThreadConstraints.h` and its parallel
  counter machinery are gone; `reportRealtimeMisuse` is the only reporting call.
  A detection surface that some call sites consult and others do not reports
  "clean" for thread state it never observed. (#882)
- **Engine ownership is documented and enforced.** No singleton accessor
  survives; production runs one app-owned engine.

### Fixed

- The startup log said `Aestra v1.0.0` — a hand-written string, wrong since
  0.5 — and the build id carried no version at all. Both now come from the build,
  so a log identifies the build it came from.
- Removed an unreachable `MixerChannel` processing path that allocated scratch
  buffers per channel for a function nothing called.

### Known gaps

- The intermittent resize failure (P0) has no reliable reproduction and remains
  open rather than silently closed.
- Automation *authoring* is still parked for v0.8.0 (FD-13); the backend
  machinery exists, the interaction does not.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet — v0.7.1-alpha was cut on 2026-09-12. v0.8.0 work lands here.

## Unfiled — shipped before v0.7.0, never assigned to a release

> **This section is mislabelled history, not pending work.** It sat under
> `[Unreleased]` below the v0.7.1 heading, which read as "none of this has
> shipped yet". It has: spot-checking three of its claims against the tree finds
> the `lowmem` CMake preset, `Source/Settings/ExportDialog.cpp` and
> `RumbleArsenalAudibleTest` all present. The content is real and released; only
> its placement was wrong.
>
> Assigning each entry to the release that actually carried it needs git
> archaeology per item, which is deliberately not guessed at here — a confident
> wrong attribution in a changelog is worse than an honest unfiled one. Until
> that reconciliation happens this heading states what is true: shipped, before
> v0.7.0, never filed.


### Fixed
- Piano Roll: dropdown menu (Scale, Snap, Root Key) now responds to clicks — was using local bounds for positioning but global bounds for hit-testing

### Audio Plugins
- **AestraComp**: Replaced peak detection with RMS — the detector now responds to sustained loudness rather than transients, matching hardware compressor behavior. Uses power-domain IIR smoothing (10ms window).
- **Rumble**: Smooth GlideCurve parameter during active glide — prevents audible discontinuities when curve is adjusted mid-glide.

### Device Resilience (EPIC K)

- **Telemetry wiring**: Driver-level underrun/xrun counters now flow to engine telemetry across WASAPI Shared, WASAPI Exclusive, and RtAudioDriver
- **Health monitor thread**: Automatic driver health polling (500ms interval, 2s stall detection → safety driver fallback)
- **Hot-plug detection**: `IMMNotificationClient` implementation for both WASAPI drivers — device removal/default device change events
- **RT safety**: Removed all `std::cout`/`std::cerr` from WASAPI audio thread loops; added Linux SCHED_FIFO scheduling + mlockall in RtAudioDriver
- **Fallback reasons**: `AudioDeviceManager` now populates descriptive fallback reason strings during driver fallback loop
- **PerformanceHUD**: Enhanced with underrun detail, overruns, consecutive underruns, recovery mode, thread priority status, and last callback timing (% of budget)
- **Driver soak test**: New `AestraAudioDriverSoakTest` exercises real audio driver path with live stream, monitors telemetry, reports every 5s
- **AudioTelemetry fix**: `lastCallbackNs`, `maxCallbackNs`, `lastBufferFrames`, `lastSampleRate` now updated every callback frame (previously always zero)

### Export / Offline Render

- **Rewrote `AudioExporter` from scratch** — the previous implementation was fundamentally broken (never started transport, never advanced position between blocks, hardcoded 60s duration → produced silence).
- Now uses `AudioRenderer::renderBlock()` — the same proven offline rendering path as `bounceRangeToWav()` — ensuring export matches real-time playback.
- **Duration computed from actual playlist** via `PlaylistModel::getTotalDurationBeats()` instead of hardcoded values.
- **Position advances correctly** between render blocks (sample-accurate).
- **Master output stage** applied during export: DC blocking, soft clipping, TPDF dither for PCM — matching the playback signal path.
- **Three render scopes supported**: FullSong, LoopRegion, Selection.
- **Bit depths**: 16-bit PCM, 24-bit PCM (stored in 32-bit containers), 32-bit IEEE float.
- **Progress callbacks** and **cancel support** for UI integration.
- **Wired `File > Export Audio...`** menu item — exports to WAV using project sample rate, 24-bit PCM, with 2s tail for reverb/decay.
- Added `friend class AudioExporter` to `AudioEngine` for safe access to renderer internals.

### Playlist / Clip Editing

- **Fixed clip split bug**: `PlaylistModel::splitClip()` now copies `patternId`, `name`, and `colorRGBA` to the newly created clip half. Previously the second half received a default empty `patternId` (value 0), producing one valid clip + one empty pattern.
- **Wired Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete** to the edit menu and keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V`, `Delete`):
  - `cutSelectedClip()` — copies to clipboard and removes via `RemoveClipCommand`
  - `copySelectedClip()` — copies to clipboard
  - `pasteClipboardAtCursor()` — pastes at playhead position
  - `deleteSelectedClip()` — removes without clipboard
- **Split tool** now works via both blade tool click and keyboard shortcut (`S` key), all routed through `SplitClipCommand` for full undo/redo support.

### Piano Roll / Pattern workflow

- **Double-click pattern clips** on the timeline to open them in the Piano Roll panel.
- **Piano Roll unit routing**: notes now carry `unitId` for Arsenal unit routing. New notes inherit the currently selected Arsenal unit.
- **Piano Roll ↔ Sequencer sync**: editing a pattern in Piano Roll refreshes the Sequencer panel. Selecting a unit in Arsenal updates the Piano Roll's editing context.
- `PianoRollPanel` now auto-saves on note changes and displays the active pattern name + unit label.

### Arsenal Panel

- **Unit selection state**: Arsenal now tracks a selected unit, highlights it visually, and broadcasts selection changes to Piano Roll and Sequencer.
- **Remove units**: Delete/Backspace removes the selected unit (minimum one unit enforced). Notes belonging to the removed unit are cleaned from all patterns.
- **Unit row redesign**: rows now show group label (Synth/Drums/Audio), source summary (Plugin/Sample/Empty), and a source tag badge. Selected rows get accent-colored border and shadow.
- **Progress header** now displays the selected unit name and active pattern info.

### Build / CI

- **Low-memory build preset** (`lowmem`): configured for 4GB RAM laptops — 2 parallel jobs, no LTO, no tests, Release mode. Use `cmake --preset lowmem && cmake --build --preset lowmem-release`.

### Internal Arsenal / Rumble milestone

- Added a verified internal instrument validation stack around **Aestra Rumble**.
- Added and validated:
  - `RumbleStateTest`
  - `RumblePluginFactoryTest`
  - `RumbleUsagePathTest`
  - `RumbleDiscoveryTest`
  - `RumbleRenderTest`
  - `RumbleArsenalAudibleTest`
- Strengthened Rumble plugin behavior:
  - aligned parameter defaults with implementation
  - added versioned plugin state blob with magic/version header
  - clarified MVP mono/decay-led note behavior
  - strengthened render regression checks for tail decay and preset differentiation

### Internal plugin architecture

- Added canonical built-in plugin metadata via `BuiltInPlugins` so internal plugin identity no longer drifts across scanner/plugin/runtime code.
- Registered built-in plugins in the normal discovery flow so internal instruments can be found via standard manager lookup.
- Made `PluginManager` headless-safe for internal plugin workflows by treating platform-utils/cache access as optional in headless mode.

### Unit / project / Arsenal integration

- Reworked `UnitManager` from a placeholder-oriented stub into a minimally real runtime/persistence layer.
- Units can now persist:
  - plugin ID
  - plugin state
  - ordering
  - route/group data
  - key UI-facing state
- Units now expose a real `AudioArsenalSnapshot` for audio-engine consumption.
- Internal plugin units now survive project round-trips and restore plugin state on load.
- `AestraContent::loadInstrumentToArsenal(...)` now creates and attaches a real plugin instance instead of creating a placeholder-only unit.
- Arsenal unit enable/attach/load flows now activate plugins consistently instead of relying on test-only lifecycle setup.

### Project reliability

- Fixed a real project serialization bug where playlist clips could be serialized with an invalid `patternId: 0` even when a valid source pattern existed.
- Restored reliable project clip round-tripping by serializing/restoring the effective pattern linkage correctly.
- `ProjectRoundTripTest` is passing again after the serializer fix.
- Added `InternalPluginProjectRoundTripTest` to prove internal instrument units survive save/load.

### Audible proof

- Added `ArsenalInstrumentAttachmentTest` to verify units expose attached plugins to the audio path.
- Added `RumbleArsenalAudibleTest` to prove headless Arsenal pattern playback can route MIDI to Rumble and produce real audible output.

### Documentation

- Updated README and core technical docs to reflect the current verified March 2026 state instead of older aspirational roadmap language.
- Added a documented high-value confidence suite in `docs/technical/testing_ci.md`.
- Updated roadmap/task-list docs with the new internal Arsenal / Rumble validation status.

### Notes

- `OfflineRenderRegressionTest` is built and available, but remains fixture-driven rather than self-contained.
- It still needs canonical `.aes` + reference WAV fixtures before it can act as a dependable nightly/CI regression gate.

## v0.1.1 - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **ASIO Driver Support** (Professional Audio):
    - **Dual-Tier Driver System**: Seamless startup with automatic failover between ASIO (via `ASIODriver`) and WASAPI/DirectSound (via `RtAudioBackend`).
    - **Native COM Integration**: implemented a clean-room `ASIODriver` class handling safe COM loading (`QueryInterface`), binary compatibility (`__stdcall`, 4-byte packing), and STA threading enforcement.
    - **Low-Latency Streaming**: Verified sample-accurate callback loop (`bufferSwitch`) with zero allocations and lock-free processing.
    - **Robust Diagnosis**: Added detailed error reporting for COM (`HRESULT`) and ASIO initialization failures.

### Optimized

- **Audio Engine Performance**:
    - **Pan Law**: Replaced expensive per-sample trigonometry (`sin`/`cos`) with per-block gain smoothing (`gainL`/`gainR`), significantly reducing CPU overhead in the mixing loop.
    - **Resampling**: Implemented pre-calculated window tables for all Sinc Interpolators (8, 16, 32, 64-point), removing iterative Bessel function calculations from the audio callback.

### Fixed

- **Audio Engine Stability**:
    - Fixed "Master Silence" bug where buffer reallocation invalidated routing pointers (added `compileGraph` to `setBufferConfig`).
    - Restored missing audio summing loop in `renderGraph`.
    - Added Safety Fallback for unmapped tracks to ensure consistent gain behavior if UI parameters are missing.

## v0.1.0 - 2025-12-23

### Added

- **Audio Preview Scrubbing**:
    - Real-time scrubbing (click/drag) on waveforms in the File Preview Panel.
    - Dual-mode duration: 8-second initial limit, unlocked to 300 seconds upon scrubbing.
    - Auto-restart logic: Scrubbing a finished sample now automatically restarts playback from the seek point.
    - Real-time playhead visualization on the waveform.
- **File Preview Panel UX**:
    - Professional "Empty State" with a large file icon when no selection is active.
    - Improved Metadata display: Duration, Sample Rate, and Channel configuration.
    - Compact Folder info layout with side-by-side icon and text.

### Fixed

- **Audio Engine**:
    - Fixed critical crash/silence issue when scrubbing short samples or performing rapid seek requests.
    - Removed hardcoded 5-second duration limit in `AestraContent`.
    - Fixed duplicate `seek` method implementation in `PreviewEngine`.
- **UI**:
    - Fixed Folder name clipping/ellipsis behavior in the Preview Panel.
    - Disabled playback interactions for folders to prevent invalid engine states.
- **Build System**:
    - Suppressed CMake deprecation warnings from the FreeType dependency for cleaner build output.

### Changed

- **Tests**:
    - Updated `WavLoaderTest.cpp` to use `PlaylistTrack.h` instead of the legacy `Track.h`.
- **Documentation**:
    - Created `ALL_WALKTHROUGHS.txt` as a central index for project history.
