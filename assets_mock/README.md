# assets_mock

This folder contains small placeholder assets used when NomadPremium (models / large assets) is not present.

Purpose:
- Allow developers to build and run `nomad-core` without private model files.
- Keep small, permissive placeholder assets (short WAV samples, tiny fonts, placeholder icons).

Usage:
- Leave this folder committed in the public repo. Private assets should be stored in the `NomadAssets` or private `nomad-premium` repo.
