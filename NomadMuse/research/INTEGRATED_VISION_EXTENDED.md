## Extended Vision for Nomad Muse Multi-Modal System

**Author:** Dylan M. — Nomad Studios  
**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** Research Expansion - Integrating Generation, Classification, and Mixing Intelligence  
**Related:** NOMAD_MUSE_RESEARCH_PAPER.md (Core symbolic generation system)

---

## Executive Summary

This document extends the Nomad Muse vision from a pure symbolic music generator to a **comprehensive AI music production assistant** that integrates three complementary capabilities:

1. **MIDI Prediction & Generation** (core Nomad Muse)
2. **Real-Time Audio Classification** (instrument/percussion detection)
3. **Tonal Balance Analysis & Mixing Assistance** (spectral analysis and mastering guidance)

This represents a "best of all worlds" approach: an AI that not only creates music but understands its context (what instruments are playing) and guides its sonic quality (mix/master balance) — all running locally with <20ms latency.

---

## 1. Introduction and Goals

We propose a novel **all-in-one AI music model** that combines MIDI sequence generation, audio classification, and mixing/mastering assistance into a single system. This integrated approach addresses multiple aspects of music production that have traditionally been separate:

### 1.1 Core Capabilities

| Module | Function | Target Latency | Hardware |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------|
| MIDI Generator | Create/continue musical sequences | < 20 ms | CPU + ONNX |
| Audio Classifier | Identify instruments, drums vs. tonal | < 10 ms | CPU/iGPU |
| Mix Analyzer | Spectral balance, mastering suggestions | 100-1000 ms | CPU (DSP) |

### 1.2 Design Philosophy

**Real-time co-creation:** A musician gets AI-generated musical ideas, the system adapts to track types (drums vs. melodic), and receives instant feedback on mix/master quality.

**Local-first processing:** All computation happens on-device, emphasizing optimization for modest hardware (Intel integrated GPU or modern CPU).

**Context-aware intelligence:** The system doesn't just generate notes — it understands what it's generating (instrument context) and how it sounds (frequency balance).

---

## 2. MIDI Prediction and Generation Module

### 2.1 Foundation: Symbolic Music Transformer

At the core is the Nomad Muse MIDI generation module (detailed in `NOMAD_MUSE_RESEARCH_PAPER.md`). This module predicts musical sequences and generates new material using modern Transformer/GPT-style architectures proven effective for music generation.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Anticipatory Music Transformer approach** (Stanford CRFM, 2023): 360M-parameter GPT model with non-linear infilling capabilities
- **Separate tonal/percussive handling:** Independent controls for drum events (unpitched) vs. melodic content (pitched)
- **Multi-track representation:** Subset of tokens for drum events (no pitch scale) vs. pitched notes (key/scale constrained)

### 2.2 Drum vs. Tonal Track Handling

**Critical Insight:** Percussion produces indefinite pitch or unpitched sounds unlike melodic instruments. "Drums don't need scales" — drum hits are identified by type (kick, snare), not pitch class.

**Implementation Strategy:**
```
IF track_type == DRUMS:
    - Focus on rhythmic pattern prediction
    - Use drum hit vocabulary (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.)
    - No melodic scale constraints
    - Velocity accents and syncopation emphasis
    
ELSE IF track_type == TONAL:
    - Enforce key signature and chord progression
    - Melodic contour and harmonic rules
    - Scale-aware note prediction
    - Voice leading principles
```

### 2.3 Enhanced Training Datasets

Building on the core dataset strategy, we expand with specialized resources:

#### Primary MIDI Corpora

| Dataset | Size | Purpose | Priority |
|---------|------|---------|----------|
| **GigaMIDI** (2025) | 1.4M files, 1.8B notes | Largest symbolic collection, unprecedented variety | **CRITICAL** |
| Lakh MIDI (Clean) | 45k files | Diverse pop/rock/jazz (filtered subset) | High |
| MAESTRO v3 | 1,282 performances | Expressive piano, classical nuance | High |
| GiantMIDI-Piano | 10,855 pieces | Broad classical repertoire | Medium |
| Groove MIDI (GMD) | 13.6 hours | Human drum performances, realistic grooves | **CRITICAL** |
| E-GMD (Extended) | 444 hours | Massive drum audio corpus | High |

#### Specialized Datasets

- **Bach Chorales** (~400 pieces): Four-part harmony, voice leading
- **Theorytab Corpus** (~200k progressions): Harmonic patterns from popular music
- **EMOPIA/VGMIDI**: Emotion-labeled, video game MIDIs (stylistic diversity)

**Dataset Distribution (by training weight):**
- Classical Piano: 30% (MAESTRO, GiantMIDI)
- Pop/Rock/Jazz: 35% (**GigaMIDI** majority)
- Drums/Percussion: 25% (**Groove MIDI**, E-GMD)
- Theory/Harmony: 10% (Bach, Theorytab)

### 2.4 Real-Time Generation Strategy

**Incremental Decoding:**
- Generate small chunks (1 bar / 1 beat at a time)
- Ring buffer with 8-beat lookahead
- Nucleus sampling + temperature control for creativity/coherence balance

**Latency Budget:**
- Target: < 20 ms per prediction cycle
- Achieved via: quantized weights, efficient Transformer-lite, cached key/value states

## 3. Audio Classification for Instrument Recognition and Context

### 3.1 Module Purpose

An **audio classification module** works in tandem with MIDI generation, analyzing incoming audio or MIDI to determine:
1. **Instrument type** (drums, piano, guitar, bass, vocals, etc.)
2. **Track categorization** (percussive vs. pitched)
3. **Context for generation** (apply correct musical constraints)

**Immediate Use-Case:** Distinguish percussion from pitched instruments to guide the generative process.

### 3.2 Architecture Design

**Lightweight CNN for Real-Time Classification:**

```
Input: 20-50 ms audio frames (matching latency target)
Feature: MFCC or Mel-spectrogram (128 bins)
Network: 
    - 3 Conv layers (32→64→128 filters)
    - Global average pooling
    - 2 FC layers (256→64→num_classes)
Output: Instrument class probabilities

Classes (example):
    - Drums (kick, snare, hi-hat, cymbals)
    - Bass (electric, acoustic)
    - Guitar (electric, acoustic)
    - Piano/Keys
    - Vocals
    - Other
```

**Decision Logic:**
- Accumulate predictions over 100-200ms window
- Majority vote determines track type
- Confidence threshold: > 0.75 to switch track mode

### 3.3 Training Datasets

#### Audio Classification Resources

| Dataset | Size | Content | Use |
|---------|------|---------|-----|
| **NSynth** (Google Magenta) | 305k notes, 1,006 instruments | Single-note audio examples, labeled timbre | **Instrument classifier base** |
| **Groove Audio** (GMD) | 13.6 hours + MIDI | Aligned drum recordings | **Drum detection specialist** |
| **E-GMD** | 444 hours | Extended drum kit variety | **Drum augmentation** |
| **ENST Drum Dataset** | Varied | Labeled drum hit sounds (kick/snare/etc.) | **Percussive training** |
| **Mixing Secrets Multitracks** | 250 songs, isolated stems | Real recordings with instrument labels | **Polyphonic recognition** |
| **MedleyDB** | Multitracks | Instrument activation annotations | **Multi-instrument context** |

**Training Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1:** Train on NSynth for broad instrument recognition (80% accuracy target)
2. **Phase 2:** Fine-tune on Groove/ENST for drum specialization (95% drum detection)
3. **Phase 3:** Test on polyphonic mixes (Mixing Secrets stems) for real-world validation

### 3.4 Integration with MIDI Generator

**Information Flow:**
```
Audio Input → Classifier (10ms) → Track Type Label
                                      ↓
MIDI Generator ← Context Token ← [DRUMS] or [TONAL:piano]
                                      ↓
Generation Mode Switch: 
    - Drum Mode: rhythmic patterns, no pitch constraints
    - Tonal Mode: key-aware, harmonic rules
```

**Conditional Generation:**
- If classifier detects drum track → activate drum-specific sub-network
- If melodic → ensure notes follow key signature / chord progression
- Mixed tracks → multi-head generation with separate streams

**Benefits:**
- Musically valid output in diverse contexts
- No scale violations on melodic instruments
- Creative rhythmic freedom for drums
- Guides mixing suggestions (next section)

## 4. Tonal Balance Analysis and Mixing/Mastering Assistance

### 4.1 Objective

Analyze combined audio output (or individual tracks) to **evaluate tonal balance** and **suggest improvements** for professional sound quality.

**Tonal Balance:** Distribution of energy across frequencies (bass, mid, treble) appropriate for genre.

### 4.2 Analysis Architecture

**Spectral Analysis Engine:**

```python
def analyze_tonal_balance(audio_frame, sample_rate=44100):
    # FFT-based spectrum analysis
    fft = np.fft.rfft(audio_frame)
    magnitude = np.abs(fft)
    
    # Frequency band energy
    bands = {
        'sub_bass': (20, 60),      # Hz
        'bass': (60, 250),
        'low_mid': (250, 500),
        'mid': (500, 2000),
        'high_mid': (2000, 6000),
        'presence': (6000, 12000),
        'air': (12000, 20000)
    }
    
    energy_per_band = compute_band_energy(magnitude, bands)
    
    # Compare to genre target curve
    genre_profile = load_genre_curve(current_genre)
    deviation = energy_per_band - genre_profile
    
    return deviation, suggestions(deviation)
```

**Genre Target Curves:**
- Derived from thousands of professional masters (iZotope approach)
- Profiles for: Pop, Rock, EDM, Jazz, Classical, Hip-Hop, etc.
- User can load custom reference tracks

### 4.3 Suggestion Engine

**Detection → Recommendation Mapping:**

| Detected Issue | Frequency Range | Suggested Action |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Excessive low-end | 20-100 Hz | "Reduce sub-bass by 3-5 dB, check kick drum level" |
| Muddy mix | 200-500 Hz | "Cut low-mids around 300 Hz, consider high-pass on non-bass instruments" |
| Harsh highs | 3-8 kHz | "Apply gentle de-essing or reduce presence shelf" |
| Lack of air | 10-20 kHz | "Boost high shelf at 12 kHz by 2 dB for sparkle" |
| Imbalanced stereo | Correlation < 0.5 | "Check phase issues, narrow stereo width on bass" |

**Advanced Features:**
- **Loudness analysis:** LUFS measurement, headroom checks
- **Dynamic range:** Compression detection, punch vs. squashed
- **Stereo imaging:** Correlation meter, mono compatibility
- **Transient analysis:** Attack clarity, over-compression warnings

### 4.4 Training Data for Mix Intelligence

| Resource | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Reference Mix Libraries** | Thousands of professional mixes | Derive genre target curves |
| **Mixing Secrets Multitracks** | Raw stems + premixed reference | Learn "before → after" transformations |
| **Mix Evaluation Dataset** | 180 mixes with EQ/compression settings + ratings | Correlate settings with quality scores |
| **AES HiFi Mastering** | Competition data | Professional mastering examples |

**Training Approach:**
- **Supervised:** Learn mapping from raw spectrum → recommended adjustments
- **Preference learning:** Train on rated mixes (high-rated = target)
- **Transfer learning:** Fine-tune on user's personal music library

### 4.5 Real-Time Performance

**Efficiency Strategy:**
- Spectrum analysis: Fast FFT on 20-50 ms frames
- Update frequency: 500 ms - 2 sec (not every audio buffer)
- Separate thread from audio processing (non-blocking)
- Rule-based logic + tiny ML model (<100k params)

**Latency Budget:** Analysis doesn't need to be <20ms (not in audio path). Can update suggestions every 1-2 seconds, which feels real-time to user.

**Hardware Acceleration:**
- **CPU:** ONNX Runtime with MKL-DNN, AVX-512
- **iGPU:** Intel OpenVINO for classifier (optional)
- **GPU:** CUDA support for training only (inference = CPU)

**Memory Layout:**
- Row-major, cache-aligned buffers
- Operator fusion (combine GRU gates)
- Batch size = 1 (optimize for single-sequence)

### 7.3 Fallback Strategies

**If latency exceeds budget:**
- Generator: Use last valid prediction, reduce lookahead
- Classifier: Cache last result, skip frames
- Mixer: Pause analysis until CPU available

**Confidence thresholds:**
- Only suggest MIDI predictions with softmax max > 0.6
- Only switch track type if classifier confidence > 0.75
- Only show mix suggestions if deviation > 3 dB
