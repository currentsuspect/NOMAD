// Clip Movement Contract (vault: Track Lane Channel Ownership Contract §23,
// freeze 2026-08-18 @ 30d28e4).
//
// A lane is not an owner of a clip; the track is the placement owner. Moving
// a clip between lanes of the same track, or between tracks, NEVER changes
// the clip's identity — id, pattern, and metadata survive; the placement
// track derives from the destination lane. Lane-attached automation curves
// are de-facto track-scoped (§23.3) and must not transfer, copy, or clone
// when clips move.
