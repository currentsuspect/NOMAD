// FD-14 phase-5: deleting a take lane is undoable and identity-stable.
//
// Take lanes accumulate (one per take) and the UI exposes "Delete Lane" from
// the track context menu. The command must detach the lane from its owning
// Track, remove the lane AND its clips, and — on undo — restore the lane with
// its ORIGINAL id, clips, and ownership so nothing silently renumbers.
