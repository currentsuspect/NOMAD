// A drop that appends a lane is one undo step (#551).
//
// TrackManagerUI::onDrop used to call playlist.createLane() directly and then push
// the AddClipCommand on its own. The lane was therefore outside history: undoing the
// drop removed the clip and left an empty orphan lane the user never asked for and
// could not undo away. It now builds a CommandTransaction holding the lane command
// and the clip command, executed stepwise and adopted via markExecuted() +
// pushExecuted().
//
// Grouping them exposed a second defect. CreateLaneCommand::redo() used to mint a
// fresh lane ID ("the ID will be different on redo since we can't reuse the old
// ID"), but AddClipCommand still holds the lane it was constructed with — so redo
// re-created an empty lane and dropped the clip onto an ID that no longer existed.
//
// This test drives the commands directly. The UI layer is not headless-testable, but
// the transaction shape it now builds is exactly what is asserted here.
