## Milestone History

### v0.7.1-alpha — Trust Sprint (Sep 2026)

162 commits since v0.7.0-alpha. Reliability is the feature: the milestone carried exactly one new capability by design (FD-13), and everything else removes a reason a first session ends badly.

**The reported seam** — nine founder-reported bugs the week before the sprint were one family: the UI said one thing and the engine did another. Pattern edits now reach playback (split, delete, mute, solo, undo and drop all reschedule); a single stop lands the playhead at zero; recording is placed with device latency compensated and the capture stamped from the engine frame.

**Losing work is harder** — a project whose audio has moved opens with a relink dialog instead of failing quietly, and recovery no longer returns every track twice.

**The one feature** — fit audio clip to N bars, varispeed tempo-fit riding the existing ratio pipe. No new DSP, no format change.

**Trust infrastructure** — `AESTRA_RT_NONBLOCKING` makes allocation, locks and throws on an annotated real-time path a build error rather than a review note, enforced in CI; `reportRealtimeMisuse` is now the only RT reporting call, replacing a split surface that reported "clean" for thread state it never observed; engine ownership is documented and no singleton accessor survives.

**Known gaps, carried openly** — the intermittent resize failure (P0) has no reliable reproduction and stays open rather than being silently closed. Automation *authoring* remains parked for v0.8.0; the backend machinery exists, the interaction does not.

### v0.7.0-alpha — Routing, Automation & Hosting Milestone (Aug 2026)

338 PRs merged (#624–#775). The milestone's story is coherence: routing and gain staging are correct end to end, automation lanes are actually automatable, the Master channel is a real plugin host whose latency sits in the compensation graph, and the piano roll grew from an editor into a workflow.

**Routing & Mixing** — Unity gain law across live, export, isolated bounce, audition, and monitoring; single-store fader/pan; routing command seam with cycle rejection and stable send IDs; Master as a plugin host with chain latency in the PDC graph; master clips obey the live solo gate (isolation contract pinned both ways).

**Automation** — Instance-identity contract (curves follow the plugin, not the slot); automatable empty lanes; demo automation removed from default and saved projects.

**Piano Roll** — Subdivision, proportional stretching, chord-aware strokes, harmony persistence, contextual editor.

**UI** — Design constitution pass; Audio Clip editor pitching/trim/waveform/resize; timeline geometry authority.

**Reliability** — Security/durability/realtime contract lanes CI-authoritative; decision-citation and test-contract gates; plugin hosting compiled in CI, Windows plugins sandboxed; four review rounds (20 findings) on the triage branch; undici CVEs cleaned.

**PRs merged** — #624–#775 (338 PRs).

### v0.6.0-alpha — Security & RT Hardening (May 2026)

**Security** — Take snapshot path traversal guards, plugin ID shadowing prevention, premium lease hardening, CLAP SIGPIPE guard, nightly token permissions.

**RT Safety** — Waveform callback lifetime, bounded preview decodes, mixer state clamping, master limiter reshaped to cubic Hermite knee, ARM64 denormals guarded.

**Plugin Hosting** — VST3 crash handling hardened, non-finite output quarantine, effect-chain fault state ownership.

**Callback Safety** — Triple-buffer EngineState, double-buffered routing snapshot, PDC edge ownership, TSan CI.

**Serialization** — Pattern restore, BPM sync, migration roundtrip proven.

**CI/Build** — LSan advisory job, GitHub Pages deploy toggle renamed to `DISABLE_GITHUB_PAGES`.

**PRs merged** — #308, #310–#312, #331–#335, #337–#347, #350, #358, #360, #365, #367–#368 (26 PRs).

### v0.5.0-alpha — Feature & CI Milestone (May 2026)

**Takes system** — Multi-take recording with manifest, snapshots, transactional switching, path traversal guards, and UI integration.

**CLAP parameter support** — ClapParamInfo, ClapPluginParams structs, CLAP core constant definitions, null paramsExt fix.

**Audio quality** — K-weight race fix, ARM64 denormals, send gain smoother coefficient fix, audition queue deadlock fix, autosave atomic rename.

**CI hardening** — Removed jwlawson/actions-setup-cmake@v2 from all jobs, system cmake, DelayLine off-by-one fix (Capacity+1 buffer), Windows path separator fix, 13 tests registered, platform guards.

**PRs merged** — #291-#305 (11 PRs), develop→main merge (#304, 51 commits).

### v0.4.0-alpha — Hardening Milestone (May 2026)

**Security audit** — 11 findings, 8 fixed (project load hardening, crash recovery, archive extraction), 3 deferred with justification.

**Audio quality** — BS.1770 K-weighting, TPDF dither, export quantization fix, denormal protection, Boost removal.

**RT safety** — Lock-free GC flush, SPSC retirement, effect chain snapshot race fix, fadeOutActive atomic, EngineSupervisor, RTGuard, AsyncCleanupManager.

**CI/CD** — Nightly builds with ASan/UBSan, versioning/tagging policy, macOS test exclusions, CodeRabbit review fixes.

**Project infrastructure** — 69 issues opened with full taxonomy, GitHub Projects board with 5 sprints through December beta.

**Known P0 beta-blockers** — OOP plugin parameters no-ops (#238), autosave data race (#239), routing bugs (#240-#243), CLAP MIDI unimplemented (#244).
