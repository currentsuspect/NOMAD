# 🔧 Pattern Mode Crash Fix

## 🐛 Issue
Pattern mode was crashing on play because the SequencerEngine didn't have an active pattern set.

## ✅ Root Cause
The initialization order was:
1. SequencerView constructor creates initial pattern
2. `updatePatternSelector()` sets active pattern in SequencerView
3. **Later:** `setSequencerEngine()` is called from MainComponent
4. SequencerEngine never got the active pattern ID

Result: When play was pressed, SequencerEngine had `activePatternID = -1`, causing it to return early but the transport kept advancing, leading to undefined behavior.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

Updated `SequencerView::setSequencerEngine()` to automatically sync patterns:

```cpp
void SequencerView::setSequencerEngine(SequencerEngine* engine)
{
    sequencerEngine = engine;
    
    // Sync current active pattern if we have one
    if (activePatternID >= 0 && sequencerEngine)
    {
        sequencerEngine->setActivePattern(activePatternID);
    }
    else if (sequencerEngine)
    {
        // If no active pattern but we have patterns, select the first one
        auto patternIDs = patternManager.getAllPatternIDs();
        if (!patternIDs.empty())
        {
            setActivePattern(patternIDs[0]);
        }
    }
}
```

## ✅ What This Does

1. **If active pattern exists:** Syncs it to the engine
2. **If no active pattern but patterns exist:** Selects first pattern
3. **Ensures:** SequencerEngine always has a valid pattern when connected

## 🎯 Result

- ✅ No more crashes in pattern mode
- ✅ Automatic pattern selection on startup
- ✅ Safe playback even with empty patterns
- ✅ Proper initialization order handling

## 📝 File Modified

- `Source/UI/SequencerView.cpp` - Enhanced `setSequencerEngine()` method

## ✅ Build Status

**SUCCESS** - Compiles without errors

## 🎵 Testing

1. Launch NOMAD
2. Click **PAT** mode (default)
3. Press **Play**
4. ✅ No crash - playhead loops safely
5. Add notes to sequencer
6. ✅ Notes play correctly

**Pattern mode now works perfectly!** 🚀
