# Bug Report

## Description
A clear description of what's broken.

## Environment

**Platform:**
- OS: [e.g., Windows 11, macOS 14, Ubuntu 22.04]

**Hardware:**
- CPU: [e.g., Intel i7-12700K]
- RAM: [e.g., 16GB]
- GPU: [e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3060] (if relevant)

## Actual Behavior

## Logs/Output

<!--
Aestra writes two log files, and they are not copies of each other:

  runtime_log.txt    the first moments of startup — build id, working directory
  aestra_debug.log   everything after that — audio device, project load, the run

They land in whatever directory Aestra was *launched from*, not a fixed folder.
From a terminal, that directory; from a desktop icon, usually your home folder.
If several turn up, the `Working Directory:` line at the top of runtime_log.txt
says which launch each pair came from.

Both append and are never rotated, so an old file holds many runs — the lines
around the time it went wrong are the ones that matter.

If Aestra crashed or froze, please use the Crash Report template instead: it
asks for the autosave and build details that a crash needs and this one does not.
