# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add missing updateMetering method to MixerChannel



  - Add the updateMetering method declaration to MixerChannel.h
  - Implement updateMetering in MixerChannel.cpp with proper peak/RMS calculation and decay
  - Add sampleRate member variable to MixerChannel for accurate decay timing
  - Update prepareToPlay to store the sample rate
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Fix solo/mute state management in MixerChannel


  - Add soloMute atomic bool member to track solo-induced muting separately from user mute
  - Rename existing mute to userMute for clarity
  - Add setSoloMute method to MixerChannel
  - Update processBlock to check both userMute and soloMute
  - Update isMuted to return userMute only (not soloMute)
  - Update state save/load to only persist userMute
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Update Mixer::handleSoloStateChanged to use new solo/mute logic


  - Modify handleSoloStateChanged to call setSoloMute instead of setMute
  - Ensure user mute states are preserved when solo states change
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [x] 4. Fix master gain smoothing in Mixer::audioDeviceIOCallbackWithContext


  - Replace single getNextValue call with per-sample loop
  - Apply smoothed gain value to each sample individually
  - Ensure smoothing works correctly across all output channels
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

- [x] 5. Fix effects processing in EffectsProcessor::processBlock


  - Remove unnecessary temporary buffer allocation
  - Process effects in-place on the input buffer
  - Remove redundant buffer copy operations
  - Keep MIDI message handling intact
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [x] 6. Fix audio routing in Mixer::audioDeviceIOCallbackWithContext


  - Clear internal buffer before summing channels
  - Create separate buffer for each channel's output
  - Remove the code that copies internal buffer to each channel
  - Let each channel process its own audio (currently silence/source)
  - Sum each channel's output to internal buffer using addFrom
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 7. Fix pan processing for mono buffers in MixerChannel::processBlock







  - Add check for mono vs stereo buffer before applying pan
  - For mono buffers, only apply gain without panning
  - For stereo buffers, apply proper pan law
  - Ensure no out-of-bounds channel access
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Add audio source support to MixerChannel (future enhancement)






  - Add audioSource pointer member to MixerChannel
  - Add setAudioSource method
  - Add sourceBuffer member for rendering source audio
  - Update processBlock to render from audioSource if present
  - Update prepareToPlay to prepare the audio source
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4_

- [ ]* 9. Update MixerTest to verify fixes
  - Add test channel with audio source to verify routing
  - Verify meters update correctly
  - Test solo/mute combinations
  - Verify no clicks during gain changes
  - _Requirements: All_
