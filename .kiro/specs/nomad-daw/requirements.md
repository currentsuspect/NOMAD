# Requirements Document - NOMAD DAW

## Introduction

NOMAD is a professional, multi-platform Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) designed with an FL Studio-inspired workflow but featuring a modern, polished, and highly usable interface. Built entirely with JUCE/C++ for maximum performance and cross-platform compatibility, NOMAD targets Windows as the primary platform with Linux support planned for future releases. The DAW emphasizes pattern-based composition, low-latency audio processing, professional mixing capabilities, and comprehensive plugin support, all wrapped in a responsive and customizable user interface.
