# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NOMAD DAW UI currently suffers from significant performance issues during window dragging and interactive operations. Users experience ghosting trails, frame drops, and laggy interactions that make the application feel unresponsive compared to professional DAWs like FL Studio. This spec addresses the root causes: inefficient paint calls, lack of GPU acceleration across all components, event loop blocking, transparency overdraw, and frame timing issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Implement GPU-Accelerated Rendering

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth 60 FPS UI interactions, so that dragging windows and adjusting controls feels responsive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any UI component is rendered THEN it SHALL use GPU acceleration via OpenGL
2. WHEN a window is dragged THEN the frame rate SHALL maintain 60 FPS without drops
3. WHEN multiple windows overlap THEN compositing SHALL be hardware-accelerated
4. IF OpenGL is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to software rendering with a warning

### Requirement 2: Implement Dirty Region Rendering

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI to only redraw changed regions, so that CPU/GPU resources are used efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a window moves THEN only the old position and new position areas SHALL be redrawn
2. WHEN a control changes THEN only that control's bounding box SHALL be invalidated
3. WHEN the background is static THEN it SHALL NOT be redrawn every frame
4. WHEN multiple regions need updates THEN they SHALL be batched into a single render pass

### Requirement 3: Implement Cached Rendering for Static Elements

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to feel instant, so that I can focus on making music instead of waiting for redraws.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main background is drawn THEN it SHALL be cached in a texture
2. WHEN a window's content is static THEN it SHALL be cached and reused
3. WHEN a cached element needs updating THEN only that element SHALL be re-rendered
4. WHEN memory is constrained THEN the oldest cached textures SHALL be evicted

### Requirement 4: Optimize Window Dragging Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag windows smoothly without ghosting or trails, so that the interface feels polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a window is being dragged THEN visual effects (blur, shadows) SHALL be temporarily disabled
2. WHEN dragging starts THEN the window SHALL switch to a lightweight rendering mode
3. WHEN dragging ends THEN full visual fidelity SHALL be restored within 100ms
4. WHEN a window moves THEN position updates SHALL use transform-based movement, not pixel re-rendering

### Requirement 5: Fix Event Loop and Thread Blocking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI events to be processed asynchronously, so that the render thread never blocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a drag event occurs THEN position calculations SHALL NOT block the main UI thread
2. WHEN multiple events queue up THEN they SHALL be processed in batches
3. WHEN the render loop runs THEN it SHALL be independent of event processing
4. WHEN frame timing is measured THEN each frame SHALL complete in under 16.67ms (60 FPS)

### Requirement 6: Implement VSync and Frame Timing

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations without tearing or jitter, so that the UI feels professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering occurs THEN it SHALL be synchronized to the display refresh rate
2. WHEN frame timing varies THEN position interpolation SHALL smooth out movement
3. WHEN the target is 60 FPS THEN frames SHALL be delivered at consistent 16.67ms intervals
4. WHEN VSync is enabled THEN double buffering SHALL prevent tearing

### Requirement 7: Optimize Transparency and Compositing

**User Story:** As a user, I want beautiful UI effects without performance penalties, so that the DAW looks and feels premium.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN windows have transparency THEN compositing SHALL use GPU blend modes
2. WHEN shadows are rendered THEN they SHALL use pre-rendered textures, not real-time blur
3. WHEN overdraw occurs THEN the renderer SHALL minimize redundant pixel writes
4. WHEN effects are expensive THEN they SHALL be disabled during drag operations

### Requirement 8: Add Performance Monitoring and Profiling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to measure frame timing and identify bottlenecks, so that I can optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN frame time SHALL be displayed in milliseconds
2. WHEN a frame takes too long THEN a warning SHALL be logged with timing breakdown
3. WHEN profiling is active THEN render passes SHALL be individually timed
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify which component is slow

### Requirement 9: Implement Component-Level OpenGL Context Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each major component to manage its own OpenGL context, so that rendering is isolated and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is created THEN it SHALL attach an OpenGL context if appropriate
2. WHEN a component is destroyed THEN its OpenGL context SHALL be properly cleaned up
3. WHEN multiple components render THEN their contexts SHALL not interfere with each other
4. WHEN OpenGL state changes THEN it SHALL be scoped to the component's context

### Requirement 10: Optimize Repaint Calls

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to minimize unnecessary repaint() calls, so that the UI only redraws when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a property changes THEN repaint SHALL only be called if the visual output changes
2. WHEN multiple properties change THEN repaints SHALL be coalesced into a single call
3. WHEN a timer fires THEN it SHALL only trigger repaints for animated elements
4. WHEN a component is hidden THEN it SHALL NOT trigger repaints
